# 🌍 HungerCoin & FeedHunger.org

**Empowering the world’s farmers. Feeding the world’s hungry. Powered by blockchain.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**HungerCoin** is a USD-pegged utility cryptocurrency built on the **Solana** blockchain, designed to power [FeedHunger.org](https://feedhunger.org)—a decentralized and transparent marketplace that connects local food producers directly with food-insecure communities around the globe.

By combining the speed and scalability of Solana with smart arbitrage logic and real-time trade transparency, HungerCoin and FeedHunger.org aim to:

- Eradicate food deserts
- Foster sustainable agriculture
- Lower food costs worldwide
- Empower small-scale farmers
- Restore dignity through direct trade

Over **800 million people face hunger daily**, often due to systemic inefficiencies, economic barriers, and corrupt intermediaries. This project introduces a *real solution*: food distribution on a trustless, transparent blockchain—available to everyone with a smartphone and internet access.

## 💡 Mission & Vision

> **Mission**: To eliminate hunger through decentralized technology that ensures affordable access to nutrient-rich food, direct farmer empowerment, and global collaboration.

> **Vision**: A world where food deserts are transformed into thriving, self-sustaining ecosystems by enabling peer-to-peer food trade with zero exploitation.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

- **🌾 End Hunger**  
  Provide seamless, low-cost access to fresh food in underserved urban and rural areas by connecting buyers directly with producers—no middlemen, no inflated prices.

- **👩‍🌾 Empower Farmers**  
  Enable small-scale farmers to set their own prices, manage listings, and earn direct profits on a global platform that removes traditional gatekeepers.

- **🌱 Promote Sustainability**  
  Reduce emissions via local sourcing and regenerative agriculture. Encourage sustainable practices and carbon-neutral logistics through smart integrations.

- **📈 Leverage Arbitrage for Good**  
  Use price discovery algorithms to find cross-regional trade opportunities. Profits from arbitrage are redistributed to subsidize food shipments and fund hunger relief.

## 🔁 HungerCoin: A Utility Stablecoin

**HGR** (HungerCoin) is a **USD-pegged stablecoin** used as the exclusive currency for transactions on FeedHunger.org.

### 🔹 Why HGR?

- **Global Usability**  
  Accessible anywhere via browser or mobile, empowering both urban and rural communities with direct purchasing power.

- **Ultra-Low Fees & Instant Payments**  
  Built on Solana, with sub-second transaction speeds and costs under $0.01, even micro-purchases (like a bag of rice) are affordable.

- **Charity by Design**  
  Every transaction contributes to the mission—e.g., 20% of fees go to fund free meal programs and food subsidies.

- **On-Chain Trust**  
  All activity is recorded immutably on Solana. Users, donors, and NGOs can verify fund flows, donations, and trades.
