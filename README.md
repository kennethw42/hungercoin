# HungerCoin & FeedHunger.org

## Overview
HungerCoin is a USD-pegged utility cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, designed to power FeedHunger.org, a decentralized marketplace connecting food producers globally with communities in need, particularly in food deserts. Our mission is to:

- **Address Hunger**: Facilitate access to nutritionally dense foods through transparent, low-cost transactions.
- **Empower Communities**: Fund community farms in food deserts using profits from trade arbitrage, reducing reliance on large agricultural businesses.
- **Reduce Carbon Footprint**: Optimize food trading logistics to minimize fuel and manpower, leveraging decentralized arbitrage to source local, sustainable products.
- **Decentralize Access**: Enable anyone, anywhere to buy food via HungerCoin, ensuring equitable access through blockchain transparency.

## HungerCoin: A Utility Cryptocurrency
- **Purpose**: A stablecoin pegged to USD, used exclusively to purchase food products on FeedHunger.org.
- **Real-World Application**: Enables secure, low-cost transactions for global food trading, with profits reinvested into hunger relief and community agriculture.
- **Humanitarian Impact**: Funds meals and farming initiatives in underserved areas, directly addressing food insecurity.
- **Carbon Reduction**: By sourcing nutritionally dense foods locally or regionally via arbitrage, HungerCoin reduces transportation distances, cutting fuel use and emissions compared to traditional supply chains.
