HungerCoin & FeedHunger.org
🌍 Overview
HungerCoin is a USD-pegged utility cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain, created to fuel FeedHunger.org — a decentralized, transparent marketplace that connects local food producers directly with food-insecure communities. Our mission is to eradicate food deserts through sustainable trade, community empowerment, and smart blockchain-driven logistics.

💡 Mission & Vision
🎯 Core Goals:
End Hunger: Provide easy access to affordable, nutrient-rich food in underserved communities.

Empower Farmers: Enable global farmers and cooperatives to list, trade, and profit from their produce directly.

Promote Sustainability: Reduce carbon emissions by optimizing food delivery distances and logistics.

Leverage Arbitrage: Use decentralized price discovery to lower food costs and fund local agricultural projects.

🔁 HungerCoin: A Utility Stablecoin
🔹 Purpose:
A USD-pegged stablecoin used exclusively within the FeedHunger ecosystem to purchase food directly from producers.

🔹 Key Benefits:
Global Usability: Anyone can buy food using HungerCoin, regardless of geographic barriers.

Instant, Low-Cost Transactions: Powered by Solana’s high throughput and minimal fees.

Charity by Design: Profits from arbitrage and transactions fund meals and local farming infrastructure in food deserts.

Transparency & Trust: Every transaction is recorded on-chain to ensure integrity and fairness.

🛒 FeedHunger.org: The Decentralized Food Marketplace
🔹 Features:
Built with React + Solana for speed, scale, and reliability.

Transparent, immutable blockchain records for every transaction.

Decentralized arbitrage logic finds price gaps to supply cheaper food where it’s needed most.

Local-first model: Prioritizes sourcing food from local or regional producers to reduce emissions and empower communities.

Farmer onboarding system: Farmers can register their crops, quantity, and price via a simple web app or mobile app (FeedHunger App).

Future Add-ons: Delivery coordination tools, localized chat for buyers/sellers, and governance DAO.
