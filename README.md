HungerCoin and feedhunger.org
HungerCoin is a USD-pegged stablecoin built on the Solana blockchain, designed to power feedhunger.org—a decentralized marketplace for global food trading. Our mission is to combat hunger, empower independent farmers in food deserts, and challenge Big Ag's dominance by allowing small farmers and urban gardeners to sell produce directly to buyers (individuals, food banks, and communities). This bypasses middlemen who take up to 85% of profits, promoting financial inclusion for the unbanked.

Key Features:

Pegging and Stability: 1:1 USD reserve with monthly transparency attestations to maintain trust and value.
Transaction Fees: 0.5% fee on each transaction funds hunger relief initiatives and community farms.
Arbitrage Profits: Proprietary strategies targeting 1-2% profits from Solana DEX spreads (e.g., Jupiter) to support sustainable agriculture in underserved areas.
Klamath Falls Pilot: Starting in Klamath Falls, Oregon—a farming hub with high child food insecurity (15.4% in Klamath County)—we'll onboard 20 local farmers (1,000 tokens each), facilitate 50 transactions, and fund 10 community gardens. This addresses local issues like drought and food deserts (e.g., nearby Chiloquin).
Long-Term Goals: By 2030, scale to 100 food deserts, donate 1 million meals, and generate $10 million in wealth for farmers, communities, and founders.
Why Solana?: Leverages Solana's low fees (<$0.01 per transaction), high throughput (65,000 TPS), and fast finality (400ms) for affordable, efficient food trading.
Core smart contracts (token and marketplace) will be open-sourced under the MIT License upon MVP completion, ensuring transparency and community contributions. Proprietary elements like the arbitrage bot and UI designs remain closed-source.

This project is founded by [kenneth Wilson], inspired by a personal journey of overcoming foster care, addiction, prison, homelessness, and abuse. Sober for 17 years and raising three children in Klamath Falls, the goal is to break cycles of poverty—not just for my family, but for children worldwide.
